              With over two decades of immense contribution to the Information
              and Communication Technology sector, CWG Plc has continuously
              remained a benchmark for excellence in Africa. The company
              commenced operations in Nigeria, on September 26th 1992 as
              Computer Warehouse Limited principally to cater for the hardware
              projects. In 1994, DCC Networks was established as the
              communication arm to provide VSAT, Metropolitan, Wide Area and
              Local area networks to corporate organizations. To concentrate on
              demands in the area of software solutions, system and training,
              the Expert Edge software was acquired in 1997
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              In 2005, CWG Plc was incorporated to coordinate and monitor the
              activities of the three subsidiaries. Prior to this establishment,
              a branch in Ghana was set-up in 2003 to cater to the needs of the
              West African region. The Group Company was formed to provide Head
              Office functions and Shared Resources for the subsidiaries from a
              central point to make them leaner, efficient and more
              customer-focused. By 2012, CWG Plc merged with its three
              subsidiaries and this made the subsidiaries cease to exist as
              separate entities, rather as divisions. In pursuit of its
              Pan-African Vision, CWG Plc established other regional offices in
              East and Central Africa; CWG Uganda Limited (2010) and CWG Plc
              Cameroon Limited (2012) respectively to handle the business
              interest in these regions.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              In February 2013, CWG Plc ceased to be a Private Limited Company
              and became a Public Company. Also, on the 15th of November 2013,
              CWG Plc listed its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The
              listing boosted the Market Capitalization of the NSE by about N14
              billion naira, making CWG PLC the highest capitalized security in
              the ICT sector. CWG PLC’s listing also marked the first listing on
              the exchange after the launch of the X-Gen trading engine; the
              same engine used on the NASDAQ.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              CWG Plc believes in and pursues an excellent service culture, and
              delivers its operations through global best practices using its
              ISO9001 certification process across the whole group.
